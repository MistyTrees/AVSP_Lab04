Part 1. Calculation of node rank for each node in directed graph using PageRank algorithm 
        (version in which matrix M cannot be loaded into memory)

Part 2. For each node in graph consisting of black and white nodes, we needed to calculate the distance to closest black node.
        Algorithm for finding the closest node is BFS algorithm.
